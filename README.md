# Calculator
This project builds a functional basic calculator using vanilla JavaScript.
This calculator was built using HTML, SCSS, and Javascript. The display and styling was built using HTML/SCSS, and the dynamic functionality was added using JavaScript. 

Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.
This was the first time I implemented JS into a project so I faced the following challenges: using logic to figure out the steps to build a functional calculator, implementing blank variables in JS, and the operations/numbers screen display. 
Future features I'd like to implement are: 
1. create a continous operation function,
2. Allow answers to show up to 2 decimal places, 
3. Prevent the user from clicking an operation more than once
4.Implement scientifc calculator buttons.
